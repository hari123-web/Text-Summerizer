# Text-Summerizer
Text summarization is a subdomain of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that deals with extracting summaries from huge chunks of texts. There are two main types of techniques used for text summarization: NLP-based techniques and deep learning-based techniques.
In this python project we are using NLP-based techniques.
